car.png is the foreground image to be blended into street.jpg.
blended_car_on_street.jpg is the output of the code.

It should be noted that the output has some artifacts, I will be trying to remove them in the next iterations.

Update:
The issue has been fixed, and blended_car_on_street_fixed.jpg shows the fixed image.
