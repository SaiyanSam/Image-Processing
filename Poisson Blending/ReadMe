(1).
car.png is the foreground image to be blended into street.jpg.
blended_car_on_street.jpg is the output of the code.

It should be noted that the output has some artifacts, I will be trying to remove them in the next iterations.

Update:
The issue has been fixed, and blended_car_on_street_fixed.jpg shows the fixed image.

NORMAL_CLONE vs MIXED_CLONE blend modes.
MIXED_CLONE tries to preserve stronger gradients in the foreground.
Added results of both the blend methods to show the difference.
Reason why NORMAL_CLONE looks better in our case? The background and foreground had similar gradient profiles, 
so MIXED_CLONE tried to preserve both of them, which results in less natural transition.
